            <p>This unique situation gave me an unparalleled education in life from a very early age. I am forever grateful for the incredibly DIVERSE family I grew up in. I would not be the therapist I am today without them.</p>
            <p>I’ve lived most of my adult life outside of Australia in such amazing places as London, Beijing and Jakarta. Living an international life with my husband and two kids is an awesome adventure. We’re now living the ultimate life in Bali, and we LOVE it here. Well, what’s not to love, right?!?!</p>
            <p>The one thread that runs through my entire career (and life) is my passion for helping people. Whether it’s been my own businesses, or running a corporate event company in China, I have an outlook that focuses on going above and beyond, to deliver what it is that people really need – even if they don’t even know they need it yet!</p>

It wasn't just my friends and family telling me this, it was also my colleagues, clients, acquaintances, and even random strangers – all telling me the same thing.

                <p>On the surface, my job ticked all the boxes: creative autonomy, amazing boss, exciting challenges, fascinating work stories to tell parties etc. etc… I had a nagging sense that there was something bigger for me to do.

Some days were so unbearable that I literally cried when I opened my computer in the morning to emails from said client. The annihilation was real. I couldn’t see the big picture, and despaired at which way to turn.</p>
